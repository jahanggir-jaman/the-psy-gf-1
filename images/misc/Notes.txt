Pet Readings

He started working in his family’s Tea Room in 1977, when he was 20. 

The first time he shared his gift with his parents, he was still young enough to play with toys like Elsie the Cow and got a vision of a family friend in the neighborhood. “My mother had a friend Elsie,” Jason remembered. “I loved Elsie the Cow". One day, I told my mother Elsie was here and she died.

There was just enough time for a look of bewilderment to come over my mother Claire, before the phone rang. It was Elsie’s husband. She hung herself in the basement of her home. She suffered from depression and could not deal with life after shock treatment at Parkside Nursing Home in the Bronx.

Jason’s mother reacted calmly saying “You are unique. Let’s not mention this to your father.” He went on to play with his slinky.

Jason has been gifted with clairvoyance and clairaudience. He is well versed in psychometry, channeling, palm and tea leaf reading. While he can easily use tools like tarot cards, pendulums and crystal balls, he does not need them.
